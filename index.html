            <h2>What is a Camera?</h2>
            <p>A camera is a device used to capture and record images, either as photographs or as moving images such as videos. It operates by focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive surface, such as a film strip or a digital sensor, which then records the image. Cameras have evolved significantly since their invention, transitioning from large, cumbersome apparatuses to compact digital devices integrated into everyday gadgets like smartphones. Modern cameras offer a range of features, including adjustable focus, zoom, and exposure settings, enabling users to capture high-quality images in various conditions. They are widely used in numerous fields, from professional photography and filmmaking to personal use and security applications, playing a crucial role in documenting and sharing visual information.</p>
